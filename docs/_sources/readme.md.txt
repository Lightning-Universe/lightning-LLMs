# Lightning LLMs

This project contains all utility functions to train large language models on [lightning cloud](https://lightning.ai) using [lightning apps](https://github.com/Lightning-AI/lightning). Parts of this repository may later be upstreamed to the [lightning main repository](https://github.com/Lightning-AI/lightning).






## Tests / Docs notes

- We are using [Napoleon style,](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/napoleon.html) and we shall use static types...
- It is nice to se [doctest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/doctest.html) as they are also generated as examples in documentation
- For wider and edge cases testing use [pytest parametrization](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/parametrize.html) :\]
